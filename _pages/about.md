Welcome! After graduating from the Ecole Polytechnique [Ing√©nieur Polytechnicien Program](https://programmes.polytechnique.edu/en/ingenieur-polytechnicien-program/ingenieur-polytechnicien-program) in Fall 2020, a multidisciplinary scientific Master's program with courses in Mathematics, Physics, Computer Science, Mechanics, I then obtained a Master's Degree in [General Structural Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/civil-engineering/general-structural-engineering/) at Imperial College London in Fall 2021 and a Master's Degree in [Mechanics](https://www.ip-paris.fr/education/masters/mention-mecanique/master-year-2-water-air-pollution-and-energies) focusing on Ocean and Atmosphere Mechanics at Institut Polytechnique de Paris in Fall 2022.

Currently, I am working as a visiting graduate student at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography [Air-Sea Interaction Laboratory](https://airsea.ucsd.edu/) with Dr. [Luc Lenain](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/profiles/llenain) Dr. [Laurent Grare](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XmV-fycAAAAJ&hl=en) and Dr. [Nick Pizzo](https://sites.google.com/view/nicholaspizzo/home). We are working on better understanding upper ocean and submesoscale dynamics through the use of observations of horizontal currents, vertical vorticity, horizontal divergence and strain rate from arrays of [Wave Gliders](https://airsea.ucsd.edu/instrumentation/waveglider/).

I am interested in ocean and atmosphere dynamics, and as a graduate student would like to work at the interface between theory and observations, using analytic models, field observations and idealized numerical modelling, to improve our understanding of these processes and tell exciting new stories.

Amongst others, potential topics which I would love to explore in more detail include atmospheric and oceanic turbulence, entropical approaches, interactions between different scales, air-sea interactions, vorticity dynamics, heat transport, atmospheric moist convection, interconnections with surface hydrology, tropical storms, climate extremes, climate change and equilibria, paleoclimates, and more! I am generally passionate about any question I spend enough time focusing on.

I am also fascinated by collective stories, myths and cosmologies, and the ways in which they shape our actions.
