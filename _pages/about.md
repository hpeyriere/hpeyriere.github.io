Welcome! After graduating from the Ecole Polytechnique [Ing√©nieur Polytechnicien Program](https://programmes.polytechnique.edu/en/ingenieur-polytechnicien-program/ingenieur-polytechnicien-program) in Fall 2021, a multidisciplinary scientific Master's program with courses in Mathematics, Physics, Computer Science, Mechanics, I then obtained a Master's Degree in [Mechanics](https://www.ip-paris.fr/education/masters/mention-mecanique/master-year-2-water-air-pollution-and-energies) at Institut Polytechnique de Paris in Fall 2022, focusing on ocean and atmosphere dynamics.

Currently, I am working as a visiting graduate student at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography [Air-Sea Interaction Laboratory](https://airsea.ucsd.edu/) with Dr. [Luc Lenain](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/profiles/llenain) Dr. [Laurent Grare](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XmV-fycAAAAJ&hl=en) and Dr. [Nick Pizzo](https://sites.google.com/view/nicholaspizzo/home). We are working on better understanding upper ocean and submesoscale dynamics through the use of observations of horizontal currents, vertical vorticity, horizontal divergence and strain rate from arrays of [Wave Gliders](https://airsea.ucsd.edu/instrumentation/waveglider/).

I am interested in the mechanics of the ocean and atmosphere from meter to tens of kilometers scales, and approaching these topics through physical theory and experimental observation. I hope to dig deeper into such exciting research as a graduate student.

I am also fascinated by collective stories, myths and cosmologies, and the ways in which they shape our actions.
