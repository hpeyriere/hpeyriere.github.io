After graduating from the Ecole polytechnique 'Cycle Ing√©nieur' program in Fall 2021, I obtained a Master's Degree in Mechanics at Institut Polytechnique de Paris in Fall 2022, focusing on Ocean and Atmosphere Dynamics.

I am currently working as a visiting graduate student at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography [Air-Sea Interaction Laboratory](https://airsea.ucsd.edu/) with Dr. [Luc Lenain](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/profiles/llenain) Dr. [Laurent Grare](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XmV-fycAAAAJ&hl=en) and Dr. [Nick Pizzo](https://sites.google.com/view/nicholaspizzo/home).
