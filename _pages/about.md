Welcome! After graduating from the Ecole Polytechnique [Ing√©nieur Polytechnicien Program](https://programmes.polytechnique.edu/en/ingenieur-polytechnicien-program/ingenieur-polytechnicien-program) in Fall 2021, a multidisciplinary scientific Master's program with courses in Mathematics, Physics, Computer Science, Mechanics, I then obtained a Master's Degree in [Mechanics](https://www.ip-paris.fr/education/masters/mention-mecanique/master-year-2-water-air-pollution-and-energies) at Institut Polytechnique de Paris in Fall 2022, focusing on the ocean and atmosphere.

Currently, I am working as a visiting graduate student at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography [Air-Sea Interaction Laboratory](https://airsea.ucsd.edu/) with Dr. [Luc Lenain](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/profiles/llenain) Dr. [Laurent Grare](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XmV-fycAAAAJ&hl=en) and Dr. [Nick Pizzo](https://sites.google.com/view/nicholaspizzo/home). We are working on better understanding upper ocean and submesoscale dynamics through the use of observations of horizontal currents, vertical vorticity, horizontal divergence and strain rate from arrays of [Wave Gliders](https://airsea.ucsd.edu/instrumentation/waveglider/).

I am interested in ocean and climate dynamics, and would like to build an approach at the interface between theory and observations, using analytic models, field observations and idealized numerical modelling. 

Amongst others, potential topics which I would love to explore in more detail as a graduate student include atmospheric and oceanic turbulence, interactions between different scales, air-sea interactions, vorticity dynamics, interconnections with surface hydrological processes, paleoclimates, and more! I am generally passionate about any question I spend enough time focusing on.

I am also fascinated by collective stories, myths and cosmologies, and the ways in which they shape our actions.
