I graduated from the Ecole polytechnique [Ing√©nieur Polytechnicien Program](https://programmes.polytechnique.edu/en/ingenieur-polytechnicien-program/ingenieur-polytechnicien-program] in Fall 2021, a pluridisciplinary Master of Engineering, Science and Technology with courses in Mathematics, Physics, Computer Science, Mechanics. I then obtained a Master's Degree [Mechanics](https://www.ip-paris.fr/education/masters/mention-mecanique/master-year-2-water-air-pollution-and-energies)

at Institut Polytechnique de Paris in Fall 2022, focusing on ocean and atmosphere dynamics.

I am currently working as a visiting graduate student at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography [Air-Sea Interaction Laboratory](https://airsea.ucsd.edu/) with Dr. [Luc Lenain](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/profiles/llenain) Dr. [Laurent Grare](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XmV-fycAAAAJ&hl=en) and Dr. [Nick Pizzo](https://sites.google.com/view/nicholaspizzo/home).

I am interested in the dynamics of the ocean and atmosphere, turbulence.
