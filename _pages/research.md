I am interested in ocean and atmosphere dynamics, and as a graduate student would like to work at the interface between theory and observations, using analytic models, field observations and idealized numerical modelling to improve our understanding of underlying processes and tell exciting new stories.

Amongst others, potential topics which I would love to explore in more detail include atmospheric and oceanic turbulence, entropical approaches, interactions between different scales, air-sea interactions, vorticity dynamics, heat transport, atmospheric moist convection, interconnections with surface hydrology, tropical storms, climate extremes, climate change and equilibria, paleoclimates, and more! I am generally passionate about any question I spend enough time focusing on.

## Current research project: observation of subsurface ocean currents from autonomous surface vehicles

I am currently working on elaborating experimental methodologies enabling the observation of vertical profiles of horizontal currents, vertical vorticity, horizontal divergence and strain rates in the upper ocean. I exploit vertical Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler measurements from an array of Wave Gliders to obtain robust horizontal current vertical profiles between 1.5 m and 60 m along the Wave Glider path, with higher vertical resolution closer to the surface. Then, I consider the Lagrangian movement of the instrument platform and measured particles due to wave effects, which imply a mean drift when observing Eulerian quantities. 

These precise current meausurements enable when using conjoint measurements from arrays of several Wave Gliders to calculate vertical profiles of vertical vorticity, horizontal divergence and normal and shear strains. Analysing the flow in terms of these eigenvalues of the two-dimensional velocity gradient tensor can help undertand submesoscale features and their impact on vertical transport in the upper ocean.
