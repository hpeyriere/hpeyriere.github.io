Observation of new surface ocean currents from autonomous surface vehicles
======

I am currently working on elaborating experimental methodologies enabling the observation of vertical profiles of horizontal currents, vertical vorticity, horizontal divergence and strain rates in the upper ocean. I exploit vertical Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler measurements from an array of Wave Gliders to obtain robust horizontal current vertical profiles between 1.5 m and 60 m along the Wave Glider path, with higher vertical resolution closer to the surface. Then, I consider the Lagrangian movement of the instrument platform and measured particles due to wave effects, which imply a mean drift when observing Eulerian quantities. Finally, I use conjoint current measurements from an array of Wave Gliders to calculate vertical profiles of vertical vorticity, horizontal divergence and strain rates.
